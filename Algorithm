Analysis if Algorithm

The theroetical study if computer programme performance and resource usage

What is ins-sorts worst case time?
  Depend on computer
  -relative speed (on same machine) //相对速度
  -absolute speed (on diff machine) //绝对速度

BIG IDEA!   Asymptotic analysis （渐进分析）
1.Ignore machine deoendent constant
2.Look at growth of running time.  T(n) as n->∞

Asymptotic notation
Θ-notation Drop low order terms and ignore leading constans
